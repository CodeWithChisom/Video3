## Important Note

If you noticed, I used a lot of JS concepts like destructuring, referential equality, closures etc. in the video. So like I stated in the previous video, you have to understand the fundamental concepts of JS before starting out with a framework. If the terms I mentioned above don't make sense to you, then I suggest you hold off on starting with a framework for now.
